# NoteAPI BRANCH!
### welcome to note api branch!  
In this branch we are gonna make a more simple and readable JSON responses!  
we will deploy it to GCP cloud run and after that we are going to use this api to our react app  
my react repo: https://github.com/Riveong/ReactJS-but-I-have-ADHD/tree/Front-end

references: https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-react/#post-route  
in the future (5 hours from now(if me not forgot(im lazy))) I will make post schema so that we don't have to rely on CURL and we could just edit the body request (easy life).
